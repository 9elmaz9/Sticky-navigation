      <h2>The Universe is Expanding</h2>
      <p>One of the most profound discoveries in cosmology is that the universe is expanding. This was first observed by Edwin Hubble in 1929 when he noticed that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and the further away they are, the faster they are receding. This observation led to the formulation of Hubble's Law and the understanding that space itself is stretching, carrying galaxies along with it. This expansion suggests that the universe was once much denser and hotter, leading to the widely accepted Big Bang theory.
      </p>

      <h3> Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h3>
      <p>The universe is not only expanding but doing so at an accelerating rate. This acceleration cannot be explained by the gravitational forces of visible matter alone. Scientists have hypothesized the existence of dark energy, a mysterious force driving this acceleration. Additionally, observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters indicate that there is much more mass present than what we can see with telescopes. This invisible mass is known as dark matter. Together, dark matter and dark energy are believed to make up about 95% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, leaving only 5% for the ordinary matter that we are familiar with.
